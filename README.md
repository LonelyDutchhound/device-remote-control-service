## Description of the case from employer

* The task is to design and implement a backend service to control an appliance such as a wash machine or an oven. 
* The API should be REST based and the state of the appliance should be persisted to any form of persistent storage. 
* There is no need for any frontend, but we expect there to be a README.md file with build directions and examples of how to invoke the REST API (e.g. curl).

* The project should be implemented using Java. 
* Feel free to use any 3rd party library that you are comfortable with. 
* Unit tests are expected and the assignment will be assessed based on good programming practices and design.
